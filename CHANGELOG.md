# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2025-10-08] - Plugin Installation Path Fix

### Fixed
- **Plugin Installation Bug**: Corrected critical path expansion issue preventing external plugins from being downloaded
  - Fixed tilde expansion in plugin installation path that caused plugins to be cloned to incorrect directory
  - Changed `${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}` to `${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}`
  - Ensures `zsh-autosuggestions` and `zsh-syntax-highlighting` are properly downloaded to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/`
  - Resolves issue where plugins were enabled in `.zshrc` but never actually installed

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Shell parameter expansion does not expand tilde (`~`) characters
- **Impact**: External plugins referenced in `EXTERNAL_PLUGINS` array were not being cloned
- **Solution**: Use `$HOME` variable instead of `~` for proper path expansion
- **Affected File**: `customzsh.sh` line 130

### Testing
- ✅ Unit tests: 11/11 passed
- ✅ Plugin installation tests: 6/6 passed
- ✅ Path expansion verified with absolute paths
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility maintained
